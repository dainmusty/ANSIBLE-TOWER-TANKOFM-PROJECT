# how to create Ansible role (dont be inside the roles directory when running the command below,
it creates duplicates)
ansible-galaxy init roles/users
ansible-galaxy init roles/docker
ansible-galaxy init roles/nginx

Next Steps in Tower (AWX)

Create a Project linked to this repo.

Add Inventories (dev, prod) â†’ you can later swap to AWS dynamic inventory.

Add Credentials (SSH keys, AWS credentials).

Create Job Templates for each playbook.

Run jobs and check logs in the Tower UI.

# Install Git on AL2024
sudo dnf update -y
sudo dnf install git -y

Clone your ansible repo project



# Test dynamic inventory
1. Use the resource editor to tag instances to test your dynamic inventory

2. Based on the dynamic inventory file below, tag all instances with the key-value pair (env:dev) of the main filter () 
---
plugin: aws_ec2
regions:
  - us-east-1     # adjust when needed
filters:
  tag:env: dev
keyed_groups:
  - key: tags.role
    prefix: role
hostnames:
  - private-ip-address
compose:
  ansible_host: private_ip_address

ansible-inventory -i inventories/aws_ec2.yml --graph
# or this depending the path of your inventory file
ansible-inventory -i aws_ec2.yml --graph




# to remove directories 
rm -rf ANSIBLE-TOWER-TANKOFM-PROJECT/
rm is the remove command
-r means recursive (remove subdirectories and their contents)
-f means force (no confirmation prompts)

# use this run the plays
ansible-playbook -i inventories/aws_ec2.yml playbooks/site.yml


# Once your playbook test is successful, you can now move it to Ansible Tower for testing
1. Ansible Tower has 4 main components 
a. Project - That's your collection of playbooks
b. Inventory - Your managed assets
c. Credentials - Your credentials are used to connect to your managed assets
d. Job Templates - What enables you to run playbooks on your managed assets.

# Combine scheduling with notification
Useful for nightly backups of configuration files.

# Ansible Tower Job Types
1. Use checks to see if your env has deviated from its baseline

# Privilege Escalation
If you have set become to true, then you have check privilege escalation when defining your job templates.
