Ahh got it 👍 — thanks for pasting what you actually have.

Right now your role is built for one user at a time (user_name / user_group), so if you add user_name multiple times in the YAML, only the last one will be applied (YAML keys must be unique).

To handle multiple users, you’ll want to switch from single vars → to a list of users, and update your tasks to loop over them.

✅ Step 1: Update defaults (roles/users/defaults/main.yml)
users_list:
  - username: devops
    group: devops
  - username: finops
    group: finops
  - username: netops
    group: netops
  - username: devsecops
    group: devsecops

✅ Step 2: Update tasks (roles/users/tasks/main.yml)
- name: Ensure groups exist
  ansible.builtin.group:
    name: "{{ item.group }}"
    state: present
  loop: "{{ users_list }}"

- name: Ensure users exist
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: "{{ item.username }}"
    group: "{{ item.group }}"
    shell: /bin/bash
    create_home: yes
  loop: "{{ users_list }}"

- name: Deploy MOTD template
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: motd.j2
    dest: /etc/motd
  notify: Restart ssh


👉 That way, you just edit users_list to add/remove users, and the role takes care of creating both groups and users.

Do you want me to also add an optional field like ssh_key inside users_list, so each user can automatically get their public key installed in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys? That’s very common in practice.


🔑 Now each user gets:

Their own group

Their own account + home directory

(Optional) an ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file with their public key

Do you want me to also set passwords for these users (retrieved securely from SSM like we planned for MySQL), or are you planning to go key-only authentication?

You said:
where do i get the ssh keys?

Good question 👍.

Each user you’re creating (e.g., devops, finops, netops, devsecops) needs an SSH key pair (private + public). Here’s how you’d typically get them:

🔑 Option 1: Generate new key pairs on your machine

Run this on your workstation (or on the user’s workstation if they’ll log in themselves):

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "devops@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/devops
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "finops@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/finops
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "netops@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/netops
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "devsecops@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/devsecops


This generates:

Private key: ~/.ssh/devops

Public key: ~/.ssh/devops.pub

The public key (.pub) is what you place in Ansible (ssh_key:).
The private key stays with the user (never shared).

🔑 Option 2: Ask each team member to provide their public key

If these users represent actual teammates (e.g., Finance, Networking, Security teams), they should generate their own keys and send you only their .pub file.
You’d then paste those values into the defaults/main.yml.

🔑 Option 3: Use AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store

Instead of hardcoding public keys in defaults, you can:

Store them in SSM parameters (/users/devops/ssh_key, etc.)

Fetch them in Ansible with the amazon.aws.ssm_parameter_store lookup.

👉 For now (testing), you can just generate the keys yourself with Option 1, paste the .pub content into the role, and later switch to Option 3 for Tower.

Do you want me to show you how to update the defaults to pull the keys directly from SSM instead of hardcoding?



That’s a great idea 👍 — you don’t want to block new users just because they don’t have SSH keys yet. We can make the SSH key deployment optional.

Here’s how to do it:

1. defaults/main.yml

Some users can have keys, some not:

---
users:
  - name: finops
    group: finops
    ssh_key: "{{ lookup('amazon.aws.ssm_parameter_store', '/users/finops/ssh_key', default='') }}"

  - name: netops
    group: netops
    # No ssh_key yet

  - name: devsecops
    group: devsecops
    ssh_key: "{{ lookup('amazon.aws.ssm_parameter_store', '/users/devsecops/ssh_key', default='') }}"


Note the default='' ensures the lookup won’t fail if the key isn’t in SSM.

2. tasks/main.yml

Add a conditional around the authorized_key task:

---
- name: Ensure groups exist
  ansible.builtin.group:
    name: "{{ item.group }}"
    state: present
  loop: "{{ users }}"

- name: Ensure users exist
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: "{{ item.name }}"
    group: "{{ item.group }}"
    shell: /bin/bash
    create_home: yes
  loop: "{{ users }}"

- name: Deploy authorized keys (only if ssh_key is defined and not empty)
  ansible.builtin.authorized_key:
    user: "{{ item.name }}"
    state: present
    key: "{{ item.ssh_key }}"
  loop: "{{ users }}"
  when: item.ssh_key is defined and item.ssh_key | length > 0

- name: Deploy MOTD template
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: motd.j2
    dest: /etc/motd
  notify: Restart ssh

🔑 Behavior

If a user has an SSM key → it’s installed.

If no key is defined → Ansible skips that task but still creates the user + group.

Later, when someone adds a key in SSM, running the playbook again will automatically install it.


back to the users, what does the task below do?
 name: Deploy MOTD template
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: motd.j2
    dest: /etc/motd
  notify: Restart ssh

That task is doing three things at once 👇

- name: Deploy MOTD template
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: motd.j2
    dest: /etc/motd
  notify: Restart ssh

🔎 Breakdown

ansible.builtin.template

Takes a Jinja2 template file (motd.j2) from your Ansible role or playbook.

Renders it (substituting any variables you defined).

Copies the rendered result to /etc/motd on the target host.

👉 /etc/motd is the “Message of the Day” file. When users log in via SSH, this message is displayed right after authentication.

notify: Restart ssh

This triggers a handler named Restart ssh.

Handlers are only run if the task makes a change.

Example: if /etc/motd content was updated, the handler will restart the SSH service.

End result

Users logging into the server will see a fresh MOTD banner.

If needed, SSH will be restarted to ensure the new MOTD is picked up immediately.
